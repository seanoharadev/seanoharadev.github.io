      <p>
        Seriously, I do appreciate you vising. My apologies that everything is
        in such a basic and unstyled state. I have not quite decided how or what
        I want to use to build this site. I know that on its own, GitHub Pages
        only supports static content. I also know there are several Static Site
        Generators (SSGs) that can be utilized. However, I have a simple problem
        at this time. I have not had the chance to look into the different
        options, and I have a lot of different thoughts, ideas, and goals that
        I'd like to do.

      <p>
        For right now, I will use this section to provide updates and links to
        other pages as I make new content. Slowly I may also make some basic
        style changes so that things look a little better. I will keep things in
        reverse chronology so that anything new is at the top of this section. I
        plan to keep each entry here fairly short, and link to a new page for
        longer content.
